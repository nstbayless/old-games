## Madness ##

ca. 2010

A puzzle-based platformer set in a world of polar coordinates. This means there's a bit of a twist to it.

The learning curve is weird. Early on there are some intimidating spikes, and about half-way through there is a fiendishly difficult jumping puzzle.

The save file does not persist when the game is closed. Be warned; it must be played in one sitting. If I ever get around to fixing up the source code I'll be sure to add this sorely-missed feature.

I was learning Japanese around this time, and for some reason thought that some hastily-drawn kanji would constitute a good title screen.

Feature added: 2016-07: saving and loading between sessions is now possible by pressing F1 and F2 to save and load respectively.
