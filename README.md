## Old Games ##

This is a repository of old games I made years ago (2007-2011). Some of them are quite silly, some are unfinished, and for some the source code has long since been lost.

Certainly for all of these games, the source code is nigh unreadable. Seriously, it makes no sense.

Currently, all uploaded games were made with Game Maker 6.0 or 7.1.

All compiled executables run correctly under wine.
