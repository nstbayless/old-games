## Old Games ##

This is a repository of old games I made years ago (2007-2011). Some of them are quite silly, some are unfinished, and for some the source code has long since been lost.

Currently, all these games were made with Game Maker 6.0 or 7.1. The source code hasn't yet been uploaded.

All compiled executables run correctly under wine.
