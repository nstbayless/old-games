## Jogging Game ##

ca. 2007

A game in which one can only move to the right and jump. Stomp the baddies, gain points, try not to die. Features a somewhat irritating soundtrack and rather poor spritework. Some baddies may or may not be thinly-veiled bootleg characters from other, better games.

The executable appears to be corrupted; at least, it does not work on any windows installation I have found. Fortunately, it does seem to run flawlessly under wine.

### Controls ###

`P - Pause`

`Up - Jump`

`Right - Jog`
